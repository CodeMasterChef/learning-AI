- ``` ** ``` like ```^```
- Just accept lowercase for first letter when create variable
- Variable in string:
    - 'My number is {} and my name is {}'.format(num, name)
    - print('My number is {one} and my name is {two}'.format(one=num, two=name))
- Get string from 0 to position 3:  ``` s[0:3]```

- unique element ```{1,1,2,2,3,3} = {1,2,3}```
