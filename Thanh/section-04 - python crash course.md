# Python crash course
- ``` ** ``` like ```^```
- Just accept lowercase for first letter when create variable
- Variable in string:
    - 'My number is {} and my name is {}'.format(num, name)
    - print('My number is {one} and my name is {two}'.format(one=num, two=name))
- Get string from 0 to position 3:  ``` s[0:3]```
- Tuple ``` t = (1,2,3)```: can't change value inside <=> constant
- Unique element ```{1,1,2,2,3,3} = {1,2,3}```
## Part 3
- List range: ```list(range(0, 3))``` => ```[1,2,3]```
- List comprehensive: ```[num**2 for num in x]```
- Use ```def``` to define a function.
- ```Shift + Tab``` to show comment of function. Comment will be inside triple quote```"""```.
## Part 4
- Lambda expression ```lambda x:x*2```
- Check exist in arr ```'x' in [1,2,3]```
